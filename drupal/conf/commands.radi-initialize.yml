# Basic new site functionality when run using radi in initialize stage
#
# Copied from default commands, but removed any permissions changes (not needed)
# and any database actions (db won't be avialable yet)
#
# This commands yml is only used by radi when it does the first initialization
# and creates a web source before the DB is ready.  It is only needed because the
# default "new" expects a DB connection
