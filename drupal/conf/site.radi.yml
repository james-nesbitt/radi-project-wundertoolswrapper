  # The final produced Drupal installation
  final: current

  # The Subpath of "final" and "temporary" where drupal resides.

  # Directory which will house all the previous builds
  previous: builds

  # Installation profile to use
  profile: config_installer

  # Site name given at installation phase
  site: %PROJECT%

  # Copy in all the needed code.
  #
  # @NOTE: docker doesn't need this, we just do it because
  #   build.sh needs it, primarily to make sure that the
  #   container paths are created when it does it's composer
  #   build.
  # @NOTE we use copy instead of link in order to make the
  #   paths work well with docker volume mounting (sym-links
  #   produce files, and we need folders.)  Ignore the static
  #   files and folders in there for now, as our docker-compose
  #   will mount the /drupal/code/X into running containers.
