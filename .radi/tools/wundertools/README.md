WUNDERTOOLS
-----------

This folder holds tools that are used to integrate the wundertools projects
into the radi implementation.

Primarily, the tools exist to build a source code image from the WT project
which can then be used by any docker/docker-compose implementation.

> See the commands in the .radi/environment/initialize/commands.yml
