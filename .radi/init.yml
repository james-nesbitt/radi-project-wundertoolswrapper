    WUNDERTOOLS
    -----------
    
    This folder hols tools that are used to integrate the wundertools projects
    into the radi implementation.
    
    Primarily, the tools exist to build a source code image from the WT project
    which can then be used by any docker/docker-compose implementation.

    You are about to run a script that will add radi configuration and aids into 
    your existing project.
    
    This process is meant to radify an existing WUNDERTOOLS D8 project, with no 
    modifications to the actual project.  This script is however not very 
    sophisticated, so there is a chance that it will overwrite an existing file.
    
    #### How it works:
    
    The process is primarily template driven.
    
    The answers to the questions asked may modify which templates are used, but 
    they are primarily used to provide string substitutions for the templates,
    and to allow you to control what actions the script will take.
    
    This script should have been run/downloaded as: 
      https://github.com/wunderkraut/radi-project-wundertoolswrapper/blob/master/.radi/tools/wundertools/radify.sh

    # radi WT wrapper
    
    This is a radi init template that can be used to make an existing wundertools
    project work with radi.
    
    Using the template, you can add the needed files to any wundertools project,
    and run a few commands to add the needed docker/radi infrastructure to use
    radi right away.
    
    ## What is added
    
    ### a number of files used to configure radi
    
    1. some base radi settings in .radi
    2. a radi command `build` which is used as a replacement for the build.sh that
       wundertools provides, which builds a full source code docker image for the
       project.  This image could be used in production.
    
    ### some files usable by docker-compose
    
    . docker-compose.yml which uses the source code image for local development.
    
    ### A radi build command
    
    you can run `radi build` which will build a new source code image for the project.
    
    ## How to use it:
    
    ### 1. Install radi-cli (https://github.com/wunderkraut/radi-cli)
    
    ### 2. In any wundertools D8 project root, use the init.yml from this repository
    
    run:
    
    ```
    $/> radi local.project.create --project.create.source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wunderkraut/radi-project-wundertoolswrapper/master/.radi/init.yml
    ```
    
    This should add the needed files.
    
    ### 3. Change some settings
    
    The only setting that needs assignment can be done by string replacing %PROJECT% 
    across all of the added files with a string name for the project.
    
    This will likey be automated next, but there are only a few instances, so it is usable
    already.
