    WUNDERTOOLS
    -----------
    
    This folder holds tools that are used to integrate the wundertools projects
    into the radi implementation.
    
    Primarily, the tools exist to build a source code image from the WT project
    which can then be used by any docker/docker-compose implementation.
    
    > See the commands in the .radi/environment/initialize/commands.yml

    # Usage:
    #   --no-composer : don't run the composer part of the build (just build the image)

    You are about to run a script that will add radi configuration and aids into 
    your existing project.
    
    This process is meant to radify an existing WUNDERTOOLS D8 project, with no 
    modifications to the actual project.  This script is however not very 
    sophisticated, so there is a chance that it will overwrite an existing file.
    
    #### How it works:
    
    The process is primarily template driven.
    
    The script will download some templates into your project, and ask some 
    questions. The answers to the questions asked may modify which templates are 
    used, but they are primarily used to provide string substitutions for the 
    templates, and to allow you to control what actions the script will take.
    
    This script should have been run/downloaded as: 
      https://github.com/wunderkraut/radi-project-wundertoolswrapper/blob/master/.radi/tools/wundertools/radify.sh
